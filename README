This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=877

<gvcolors.vim> displays a list of colors available under X-windows in their own
color.  It is based on vimtip#634 contributed by mohsin at
http://www.cs.albany.edu/~mosh.

The script intercepts several motions and sets up syntax highlighting to
display the named colors.

Example:

  gvim gvcolors.vim
  :GVColors

Motions:
	   j      move display down one line
	   k      move display up   one line
	 ctrl-d   move display down &scroll lines (see :he 'scroll')
	 ctrl-u   move display up   &scroll lines (see :he 'scroll')
	 ctrl-f   move display down one page
	 ctrl-b   move display up   one page
	 pageup   same as ctrl-b
	 pagedown same as ctrl-f

Special care to show just a single page of colors is taken because
Vim is limited to displaying approximately 224 colors with syntax
highlighting.

History/Features:

v3: Supports use of the mouse and slider bars.

v2: Looks up colors in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt,
which may be overridden by let g:rgbtxtfile="path";
now shows red:green:blue assignments as well as
the colored text!
